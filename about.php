				When it comes to something as important as the security of you
				and your family, do you really want to rely on a national based company? You
				may think that because they brand themselves as a "National Company" that they
				may have more to offer or are a more solid, stable, company. Ask yourself this
				- what is a national work pool in Florida going to do for you in the middle of
				a snow storm here in North Carolina? The answer, nothing what so ever. Second
				- if you need to talk to someone now, do you think this national company is
				going to help you? The answer, no. The point screams out at you if you look
				closely, since we are a local company, we have solid management and home phone
				numbers.

			<h2 class="featurette-heading">What makes KeepSafe so
				great? <span class="muted">And what do our competitors mean by “free” equipment?</span></h2>
			<p class="lead">
				<strong>Nothing</strong> is free. But the truth is when you get one
				of those big national companies as your security company, they are <em>leasing</em> you
				the equipment. The price rises every year and it never stops. So you are not
				rewarded for long-term loyalty but rather penalized for it. These companies
				require you to sign a 1-3 year inflexible service contract. If you are
				unsatisfied or move, they <em>do not</em> release you from the payment
				agreement.

				We work with you to develop a complete needs analysis of your premises. Then we
				recommend components to maximize the safety of you and your family from
				threats of fire, intruders and loss/damage of property. You’ll receive a
				tailored security analysis and recommendation. When you purchase the equipment from
				us, it's YOURS, no matter what the future brings. If you move, the
				equipment stays with the house, or goes with you!
