          <h2>No Contracts</h2>
          <p>We don't do service contracts, which means the equipment you buy is yours - forever. The only thing you sign is your monitoring agreement - if you elect to have your system monitored. All this states is that you agree to pay for monitoring and here is what to do in case of emergency.</p>
