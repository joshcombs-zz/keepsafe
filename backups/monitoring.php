				Here at KeepSafe, our central station is called Loss Prevention Services - located
				in Clemmons, NC. It is secured with eight inch thick
				concrete block walls, corrugated steel ceilings and quarter inch thick iron
				bar window coverings. This means that our highly secure Central Station has
				more than necessary redundancy and that these protections are provided assurance that the
				monitoring service will be there through any circumstances.
			</p>
			<p>
				Power redundancy
				is created through two propane fueled 25,000 Watt generators connected to two
				separate transfer switches that monitor the main power supply. In the
				event of a power drop, these power supplies will automatically start the generators and take over
				the central stations power load without human intervention. In the event the
				first generator fails to start, the second generator takes over. Each
				generator is tested weekly on load for a half hour and is constantly alarm
				monitored for security.
			</p>
			<p>
				Behind the state-of-the-art firewalls, we have
				triple redundant database servers, which by "UL" standards eliminates the
				requirement for a central station to maintain hard copy backups of all account
				information, but we exceed the standard by maintaining hard copy back ups
				anyway. In addition, all automation systems are supported by a 9,000 Watt UPS
				system providing uninterrupted power should a switch over become necessary.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our primary communications network is provided by three national telephone
				service companies via a main telephone service trunk fed underground to a
				private termination box inside the central station.
			</p>
			<p>
				Live Operators are on duty
				every minute of every day of the year. They are carefully selected in
				accordance with state regulations, are highly trained to handle any alarm
				situation, and are licensed with the NC Alarm Systems Licensing Board. In
				addition, they are required to maintain a level of proficiency through state
				mandated continuing education training classes during each two year licensing
				period.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the event of a major catastrophe requiring the relocation of
				operations, a subsidiary station employing redundancies equal to their main
				facility is available within a three minute drive. All staff members are
				trained for this possibility and a disaster drill is conducted annually to
				insure a quick and efficient relocation.
