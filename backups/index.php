			<h3><span class="label label-success">NO CONTRACTS</span></h3>
				<p>We don't do service contracts, which means the equipment you buy is yours - forever. The only thing you sign is your monitoring agreement - if you elect to have your system monitored. All this states is that you agree to pay for monitoring and here is what to do in case of emergency.</p>

		<div class="col-lg-4 text-center">
			<h3><span class="label label-success">LOW MONITORING COST</span></h3>
			<p>“Free” systems generally carry higher monthly monitoring costs that have increased significantly over time. KeepSafe Security is less expensive over the life of the equipment. We do not have a service contract. You have the freedom to choose, so we keep our rates competitive and deliver quality service.</p>
