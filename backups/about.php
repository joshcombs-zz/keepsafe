				But what if I want to use another alarm
				company?
			</h4>
				<p>When it comes to something as important as the security of you
					and your family, do you really want to rely on a national based company? You
					may think that because they brand themselves as a "National Company" that they
					may have more to offer or are a more solid, stable, company. Ask yourself this
					- what is a national work pool in Florida going to do for you in the middle of
					a snow storm here in North Carolina? The answer, nothing what so ever. Second
					- if you need to talk to someone now, do you think this national company is
					going to help you? The answer, no. The point screams out at you if you look
					closely, since we are a local company, we have solid management and home phone
					numbers.

			<h4>
				Well then, What makes KeepSafe so
				great and what do our competitors mean by “free” equipment?
			</h4>
				<p>
					<strong>Nothing</strong> is free. But the truth is when you get one
					of those big national companies as your security company, they are <em>leasing</em> you
					the equipment. The price rises every year and it never stops. So you are not
					rewarded for long-term loyalty but rather penalized for it. These companies
					require you to sign a 1-3 year inflexible service contract. If you are
					unsatisfied or move, they <em>do not</em> release you from the payment
					agreement.

					We work with you to develop a complete needs analysis of your premises. Then we
					recommend components to maximize the safety of you and your family from
					threats of fire, intruders and loss/damage of property. You’ll receive a
					tailored security analysis and recommendation. You purchase the equipment from
					KeepSafe and it''s YOURS, no matter what the future brings. If you move, the
					equipment stays with the house, or goes with you!
